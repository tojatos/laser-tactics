A turn consists of two moves.

Possible moves:

- rotating a piece by any degree
- moving a piece by one field
- shooting a laser

Notation:

move1 ; move2 -> whole turn notation

[position1]-[position2] -> move notation
[position1]-[position2](teleportPosition) -> teleportation notation
[position1]x[position2] -> capture notation
[position](rotationDegree) -> rotation notation
Laser -> laser has been shot

a2-a3 -> piece moved from a2 to a3
a2-a3(b1) -> hypercube moved from a2 to a3 and teleported piece to b1 / -> piece moved from a2 to a3 on a hypersquare and teleported on b1
a2(1) -> piece rotated by 90 * 1 degrees

a2-a3 ; a3(2) -> piece moved from a2 to a3 and rotated by 180 degrees
